#ELECTROBOMB
This program is meant to be viewed in its code, not to be put into action.
If you want to use it, take a look at it first and let me know if you find any bugs,
etc. If you don't want a bunch of files, it's better to use the setup.
Every day I create new projects to keep myself updated, so feel free to give me some advice. You can message me through
Electrobomb function 8.
